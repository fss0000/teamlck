# Teamlck
We are the team that write a code something everyday. The goal is to write either programming or manual page at least 10 minutes a day.

## Contribute
In this chapter, how to contribute to Teamlck will be instroduced.

### Writing commit message
Please write all commit message in english. If you have trouble writing in english, you should use easy sentense. Never spend time of writing message more than programming. You can write only 1 line, title message likes following messages.

```text
Fix mouse scoll bug
Add wheel event listner
Remove unused code
```

And here is some useful tip for commit message.

**1. Write first letter to be capitalized.**
```text
Update readme.md
```

**2. Do not put a period end of title.**
```text
Handle pinch gesture for mobile
```

**3. Use imperative sentence in title. (start at verb.)**
```
Merge branch 'feature/infinite-scroll'
```

If you want to know whether your commit message is good, put your message behind of `If applied, this commit will __________`

```text
If applied, this commit will merge branch 'feature/infinite-scroll'
If applied, this commit will handle pinch gesture for mobile
```
