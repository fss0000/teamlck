## How to write commit message
Please write all commit messages in English. If you have a trouble writing in English, you should use easy sentense. Never spend time of writing messages more than programming. You can also write only 1 line, title message, as follows:

```text
Fix mouse scoll bug
Add wheel event listner
Remove unused code
```

And here is some useful tip for commit message.

**1. Write first letter to be capitalized.**
```text
Update readme.md
```

**2. Do not put a period at the end of title.**
```text
Handle pinch gesture for mobile
```

**3. Use imperative sentence in title. (start at verb.)**
```
Merge branch 'feature/infinite-scroll'
```

If you want to know whether your commit messages is good, put your message behind of `If applied, this commit will __________`

```text
If applied, this commit will merge branch 'feature/infinite-scroll'
If applied, this commit will handle pinch gesture for mobile
```
